# My Daily Learning Journey

Welcome to my journey of becoming a skilled penetration tester! In this repository, I will track my progress as I learn the techniques, tools, and skills required to become an expert in penetration testing. Every day, I will update my progress, share what I’ve learned, and document the challenges I face along the way.
